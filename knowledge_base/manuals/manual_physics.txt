1. THERMOCLINES AND SHADOW ZONES
A thermocline is a distinct layer in a large body of fluid in which temperature changes more rapidly with depth than it does in the layers above or below. In submarine warfare, the thermocline acts as a "sonic mirror." 
- Above the layer: Sound tends to refract upward (surface duct).
- Below the layer: Sound refracts downward.
- The interface creates a "Shadow Zone" where hull-mounted mid-frequency sonars cannot detect targets. 
TACTIC: To remain undetected by a surface destroyer (DDG), position the submarine 50ft below the calculated layer depth.

2. CAVITATION INCEPTION
Cavitation occurs when the pressure on the back of the propeller blade drops below the vapor pressure of water, forming bubbles that collapse noisily.
- Inception Speed varies with depth.
- Formula Aproximation: V_cav = 1.2 * sqrt(Depth_in_feet).
- At periscope depth (60ft), cavitation may begin at 8 knots.
- At deep test depth (>800ft), speeds of 25+ knots may be sustained without cavitation.

3. PRESSURE HULL INTEGRITY (SUBSAFE)
The pressure hull is a high-yield HY-80 or HY-100 steel cylinder. 
- "Circle Mike" is the emergency command for hull breach. 
- At depths exceeding 500ft, seawater ingress pressure creates specific challenges.
- A 2-inch flooding casualty at 800ft allows ~2000 gallons per minute (GPM) ingress.
- Immediate Actions: High-pressure air blow (Emergency Main Ballast Tank Blow) is the only method to overcome negative buoyancy if propulsion is lost.

4. HYDROSTATIC LAWS
- PASCAL'S LAW: A change in pressure at any point in an enclosed fluid at rest is transmitted undiminished to all points in the fluid. 
- Formula: Delta P = rho * g * (Delta h). 
- Application: This law is the basis for submarine hydraulic systems, including the steering gear and diving plane actuators. If a leak exists in the hydraulic header, pressure will drop globally across the branch, as per Pascal's Principle.
- ARCHIMEDES' PRINCIPLE: Any object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
- SUBMARINE APPLICATION: To dive, the submarine increases its weight by flooding main ballast tanks (MBT) until weight > buoyant force. To surface, compressed air "blows" the water out.
