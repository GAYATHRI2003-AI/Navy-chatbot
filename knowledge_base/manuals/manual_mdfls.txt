### MDFLS: Multimodal Defense Sonar Dataset Memory
The MDFLS dataset provides high-fidelity baseline data for identifying man-made objects in tactical sonar feeds.

#### Scenarios & Tactical Significance:
- **Watertank**: Baseline detection signatures in controlled acoustic environments.
- **Turntable**: 360-degree yaw rotation profiles. Used for identifying "opposite troop" hulls and equipment signatures from any approach angle.
- **Flooded Quarry**: High-clutter, "murky water" conditions. Used to train RAG systems to distinguish between natural debris and tactical threats.

#### Acoustic Material Profiles:
1. **Pipes (Man-made)**:
   - **Visual Signature**: Long, linear geometry, often with high-intensity specular highlights.
   - **Acoustic Profile**: High-intensity backscatter with frequency-dependent scattering.
2. **Metal Buckets (Foreign Equipment Proxy)**:
   - **Visual Signature**: Circular or cylindrical geometry.
   - **Acoustic Profile**: Strong secondary reflections due to internal resonance of the metallic cavity.
3. **Tires (Debris Proxy)**:
   - **Visual Signature**: Toroidal or circular with low-intensity "soft" backscatter compared to metal.
   - **Acoustic Profile**: Diffuse scattering; used to calibrate "false positive" filters for sonar operators.

#### Identification Logic (Instruction):
- **Condition**: "High-intensity backscatter with a circular geometry."
- **Analysis**: Circular geometry indicates a likely man-made artifact or metallic container. High-intensity backscatter suggests high acoustic impedance (likely metallic).
- **Classification**: Possible metal equipment box or proxy bucket. Monitor for secondary resonance tonals.
